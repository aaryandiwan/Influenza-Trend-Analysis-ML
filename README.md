# Predicting Seasonal Influenza Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project analyzes seasonal influenza trends using the WHO Influenza Surveillance dataset.
Machine learning and time-series techniques are applied to estimate long-term and seasonal
influenza activity patterns across multiple countries.

## Dataset
- Source: WHO Influenza Surveillance Dataset
- Records: 180,000+ weekly entries
- Coverage: Global, multi-year
- Data Type: Aggregated laboratory surveillance data

- ## Dataset Access
The WHO Influenza dataset is large and cannot be uploaded directly.
It can be downloaded from the official WHO website:
https://www.who.int/teams/global-influenza-programme/surveillance-and-monitoring/influenza-surveillance


## Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering (Lag & Rolling Features)
- Machine Learning Models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest
  - ARIMA
  - LSTM

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

## Key Findings
- Random Forest outperformed baseline models
- Strong seasonal patterns observed
- COVID-19 caused a significant dip in influenza activity
- Influenza A dominates over Influenza B
